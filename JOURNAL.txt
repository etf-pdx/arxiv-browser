The hardest part of getting started with this project was trying to ideate what exactly I should make.
I started by perusing the provided public API list and seeing which ones were interesting and feasible for me to manage on my own.
The avatar generators https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api and maybe even https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ seemed intriguing to me immediately, but gave no inspiration as to how to make that a dashboard application.

I also thought that https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3 seemed interesting too, but still no ideas.
Upon seeing https://github.com/fawazsullia/password-generator/, I thought perhaps I could make a sort of web page where you type in your email and then it checks if you're vulnerable and where - and offers new passwords for website your email may have been hacked.
I decided to keep that in my back pocket, feeling like it may be hard to expand from that to reach my 1000 lines.

Then I saw arXiv (https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual) and felt really inspired and wanted to make a little educational dashboard application that allowed you to peruse their articles by genre and with a search bar, sort by recency, etc.
I could make a dashboard application which first used https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api to generate a new user profile with their educational preferences and store that seed and info as a browser cookie.
When the cookie is present, it loads a dashboard with list of their liked genres at the left and a feed with recent news at the right.
A search bar will be at the top of the feed, but the user can also click one of the genres at the left to filter by category as well.
At the top hovering over everything would be the user's profile bar with their username and avatar?

I decided to proceed with this idea. I first looked for anything about easy cookie manipulation in React. Bingo - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie.
axios works fine enough for making the API calls. I'll keep using that.
When making my own personal apps, I've always loved this site to help me get the initial piece set up: https://createapp.dev/
For this project I'm using Snowpack, which I love because it works with Typescript out of the box.
Obviously I'm using React, Jest, CSS, and Prettier. I decided to also try out Tailwind CSS since it required less dependecies than Bootstrap.
Setting up the project, I named it arxiv-browser.
